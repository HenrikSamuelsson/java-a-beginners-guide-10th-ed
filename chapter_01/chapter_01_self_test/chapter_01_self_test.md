> What is bytecode and why is it important to Java's use for Internet programming?

Bytecode are instructions that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). A machine that have a JRE and is connected to the Internet can download bytecode and run it.

To produce bytecode we start by writing Java source code which is then feed to a Java compiler. The output from the compiler will be bytecode. That can be distributed for example over the Internet to be run on any machine that have a JRE.
