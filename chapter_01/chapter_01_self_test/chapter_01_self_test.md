> What is bytecode and why is it important to Java's use for Internet programming?

Bytecode are instructions that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). A machine that have a JRE can download bytecode from the Internet and then run it.

To produce bytecode we first write Java source code and feed this to the Java compiler that will produce the bytecode that then can be distributed over the Internet to be run on any machine that have a JRE.
